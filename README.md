# Hand_Writing-Digit-Classification-Model
A handwriting text identifier model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize handwritten digits from images. The project includes preprocessing steps like grayscale conversion, resizing, and normalization, followed by digit classification with a trained CNN using TensorFlow and OpenCV.
